# angular-todo

Angular todo is a pet project to improve my angular/flask skills.

## Structure
This project runs both the front-end and the back-end. The back-end is called api, which can be found in the corresponding folder. All of the angular code is in front-end. 

## Installation
Install the project to your server by cloning this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Drvanon/angular-todo
cd angular-todo
```
### API server install
To install the api server, make sure you have a current version of python installed as well as pipenv.
```bash
pipenv install
```

### Front end install
Make sure you have nodejs and npm installed on your server and run `npm install` in the front-end folder.
